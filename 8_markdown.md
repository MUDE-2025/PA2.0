# Report in a markdown file

## Task 8.1 Write some basic markdown
Try to replicate the piece of text in the figure here using markdown. If you have no idea what Markdown is, you probably didn't pay attention to the README and need to do the reading in the book! [Here is a handy link](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025/programming/week_1_2/markdown.html).

Here is the example to replicate:

### My First Markdown Document

This is my introduction to *markdown formatting*. I'm learning how to use various formatting options so that I can style my reports.

**Skills I'm practicing:**

1. Making text bold and italic
2. Creating ordered and unordered lists
3. Adding code snippets
4. Creating headers and subheaders

**Important programming concepts:**

- Variables store data values
- Functions are reusable blocks of code  
- `print()` is a built-in Python function
- Comments help explain code to others

Here's a simple Python example:

```python
# This is a comment
name = "MUDE Student"
age = 20
print(f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

*Remember: Practice makes perfect!*


## Task 2.2 Open rendered markdown preview

Test out the rendered markdown preview in VS code (CTRL+SHIFT+V). Is it identical to the image?

## Task 2.3 Create a markdown table

Now try to replicate the following markdown table (you can copy-paste the star emoji ⭐):
