# Install VS Code

VS code is used as an IDE for MUDE because of it's versatility, wide-spread use in the industry and the integration of GitHub Copilot (an AI pair developer). 

## Task 3.1 Install VS Code

Download and install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

## Task 3.2 Install extension

Install at least in the 'Extensions' tabs in VS code (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `X`):

- Python extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python
- Jupyter extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter

## Task 3.3 Activate Auto-Save

By default VS Code does not save your work, you must do it manually (e.g., CTRL+S, or COMMAND+S). Unsaved files are recognizable in VS Code with a colored circle visible in the tab with the file name at the top of the window (try making a change and saving the file to see the circle disappear). You can enable automatic saving easily, which can save headaches later on. To do this, open the command palette (under toolbar "View"), then type "auto save" and select "toggle Auto Save."

_Side note: the Command Palette is very useful for searching for and changing setting in VS Code._
