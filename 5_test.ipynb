    "In a simple sense, Jupyter Notebooks are documents that consist of many _cells._ Some _cells_ are formatted text (Markdown, like this one), others can be used to execute Python code. Because we have already set up a _conda environment_ that includes the Python programming language, all we have to do is tell VS Code (VSC) which environment to use and it will take care of sending the code in the Python cells to the environment so that they can be executed as desired. Then the _output_ from running that code is displayed in the space below the Python cell from which it was executed. Let's try it with a simple `print()` statement!"
