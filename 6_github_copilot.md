# GitHub account

We'll extensively use GitHub in this course to teach you how to use git! Therefore, you'll need a GitHub account.

## Task 6.1 Create GitHub account

Create a free GitHub account here: https://github.com/signup. A few notes:

- You can use an existing account if you already have one.
- You are free to choose any user name you like.
- Your account is not required to be connected in any way to your student email or NetId. In fact, we recommend using your personal email, as then you will be able to keep your files long after you graduate from TU Delft!
